    <h1>My family background</h1>

    <p>Everyone has a family and I have also. I love my family very much. I live with my family. Today I will share something about my family. There are four people in total in our family. My parents, my sister, and me. We are a very small family.

       My father is an engineer and my mother is a doctor, but after their work, they spend so much time with us. They both love us a lot. They work really hard to make our future better. It is a very happy family. If we face any bad time, my parents handle it with care </p>
